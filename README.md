# ðŸ§  Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with exceptionally high precision on highly imbalanced datasets.

## ðŸš€ Project Summary

Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, this model achieved an **F1-score of 0.9998**, misclassifying only **1 transaction out of 50,000**.

Fraudulent transactions are rare, and detecting them accurately without overfitting is a major challenge. This project addresses that by using advanced resampling techniques and a carefully engineered pipeline.
